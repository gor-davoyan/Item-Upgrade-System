## Some Information

### Item Upgrade Logic:

The program differentiates between general upgrades (common to great, great to rare) and epic upgrades, which involve comparing upgrade counts of multiple items.

### Item Class:

Contains the item name, rarity, and upgrade count. The `toString()` method is used to display the itemâ€™s details (name and rarity).

### Inventory Class:

Stores items in a `Map<String, List>`, where the string is the item name and the value is a list of items. This allows easy management of items by their name.
